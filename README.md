## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Open the project in Godot 4.x
2. Run the project - it should work out of the box
3. Read this README to understand the architecture
4. Start building your game features!


## 📁 Game idea

This is a rythmic game where you control a snake/lasso that needs to circle entities on the map. Those entities can have various powerups that you need to manage. When you complete a level, you can ask for a powerup on your turn by turn action (a la roguelike). If you don't bite your tail,
you cut the backend part of the snake.

The win condition of a level is to remove all the entities from the level. 
The lose condition is if you can't finish because you are too small.
The tail does not shrink unless you get a malus or entities touches you then you shrink or you eat yourself at the wrong spot

##  Roadmap

## 📁 Project Structure

Understanding our folder organization is crucial for maintaining clean code:

```
project/
├── scenes/           # All .tscn files organized by purpose
│   ├── UI/          # User interface scenes (menus, HUD, etc.)
│   ├── Game/        # Gameplay scenes (levels, game world)
│   └── Components/  # Reusable scene components
├── scripts/         # All .gd files organized by type
│   ├── managers/    # Singleton systems (autoloaded)
│   ├── entities/    # Game objects (player, enemies, etc.)
│   ├── components/  # Reusable script components
│   └── ui/          # UI-specific scripts
└── themes/          # Theme related files (.tres files)
│   └── fonts/       # Text fonts

### 🎯 Why This Structure?

- **Easy Navigation**: Find files quickly by their purpose
- **Team Collaboration**: Everyone knows where to put new files
- **Scalability**: Structure grows naturally as project expands
- **Maintenance**: Easy to refactor and update related files

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Our project uses a **Manager-Based Architecture** with **Event-Driven Communication**. Here's what that means:

### Singleton Managers (The Brain of Your Game)

Managers are special scripts that exist throughout your entire game. They handle specific responsibilities:

```gdscript
# These are autoloaded - available everywhere as global variables
EventBus          # Communication system
GameManager       # Game rules, scoring, state
SceneManager      # Switching between levels, procedural creation of level
AudioManager      # Music and sound effects
InputManager      # Player input handling
SaveManager       # Saving and loading data --> maybe not used
HudManager        # Takes care of the hud
ThemeManager      # Applies themes to UI layer elements
PlayerManager     # Takes care of the player events (spawn, powerups) --> to be removed when the game jam starts
MobManager        # Spawn of the mobs, despawn, 
```

### Event-Driven Communication

Instead of scripts talking directly to each other (which creates messy dependencies), we use **events**:

```gdscript
# ❌ Bad - Direct coupling
player.health_component.take_damage(10)
ui.health_bar.update_display(player.health)

# ✅ Good - Event-driven **(important)**
EventBus.emit_signal("player_health_changed", health, max_health)
# Any script can listen for this event and react accordingly
```

## 🧠 Understanding the Managers

### EventBus - The Communication Hub

**What it does**: Allows different parts of your game to communicate without knowing about each other.

**When to use**: Whenever one system needs to tell other systems something happened.

```gdscript
# Sending an event
EventBus.emit_signal("player_died")
EventBus.emit_signal("score_changed", new_score)

# Listening for events
func _ready():
    EventBus.connect("player_died", _on_player_died)

func _on_player_died():
    # React to player death
    show_game_over_screen()
```

**Benefits**: 
- Scripts don't need references to each other
- Easy to add new reactions to events
- Makes debugging easier

### GameManager - The Game Rules

**What it does**: Manages the overall game state, scoring, lives, and game flow.

**Key responsibilities**:
- Track current game state (menu, playing, paused, game over)
- Handle scoring and high scores
- Manage player lives
- Control game pause/resume
- Handle game over conditions

```gdscript
# Examples of using GameManager
GameManager.start_game()           # Start a new game
GameManager.add_score(100)         # Add points
GameManager.pause_game()           # Pause the game
var state = GameManager.get_state() # Get current state
```

### SceneManager - Scene Transitions

**What it does**: Handles switching between different scenes (levels, menus, etc.).

**Why it's useful**: 
- Consistent way to change scenes
- Optional loading screens for large scenes
- Tracks scene history
- Handles transition effects

```gdscript
# Simple scene change
SceneManager.change_scene("MainMenu")

# With loading screen for heavy scenes
SceneManager.change_scene("Level1", true)
```

### AudioManager - Sound Control

**What it does**: Manages all music and sound effects with proper volume control.

**Features**:
- Separate volume controls for music and SFX
- Audio pooling (multiple sounds can play simultaneously)
- Fade in/out effects
- Audio library management

```gdscript
# Play sound effects
AudioManager.play_sfx("jump_sound")
AudioManager.play_sfx("explosion", 0.8)  # At 80% volume

# Control music
AudioManager.play_music("background_theme")
AudioManager.stop_music(2.0)  # Fade out over 2 seconds
```

### InputManager - Advanced Input Handling

**What it does**: Provides advanced input features beyond basic Godot input.

**Features**:
- Input buffering (stores inputs briefly for responsive gameplay)
- Input history (useful for combos or debugging)
- Context switching (different controls for menus vs gameplay)
- Easy movement vector calculation

```gdscript
# Get movement as Vector2
var movement = InputManager.get_movement_vector()

# Check for buffered inputs (great for fighting games, platformers)
if InputManager.is_action_just_pressed_buffered("jump"):
    player.jump()

# Enable/disable input based on context
InputManager.set_input_enabled(false)  # During cutscenes
```

### SaveManager - Data Persistence

**What it does**: Handles saving game progress and user settings.

**Two types of data**:
- **Game Data**: Progress, scores, unlocks (JSON format)
- **Settings**: Audio levels, graphics options (ConfigFile format)

```gdscript
# Save game data
SaveManager.save_data("level_progress", 5)
SaveManager.save_data("high_score", 1500)

# Load game data
var progress = SaveManager.load_data("level_progress", 1)  # Default to 1

# Settings
SaveManager.set_setting("audio", "master_volume", 0.8)
var volume = SaveManager.get_setting("audio", "master_volume", 1.0)
```

## 🎮 Best Practices Guide

### 1. Event-Driven Development

**Do this**: Use EventBus for communication between systems
```gdscript
# When player collects a coin
EventBus.emit_signal("item_collected", "coin", 10)
```

**Not this**: Direct references between unrelated scripts
```gdscript
# Avoid this - creates tight coupling
get_node("/UI/ScoreDisplay").update_score(new_score)
```

### 2. Proper Node Organization

**Scene Structure**:
```
Player (CharacterBody2D)
├── Sprite2D
├── CollisionShape2D
├── HealthComponent (Node)
├── MovementComponent (Node)
└── AudioSource (AudioStreamPlayer2D)
```

**Why**: Each node has a single responsibility, making it easier to debug and modify.

### 3. Component-Based Design

Create reusable components that can be added to different entities:

```gdscript
# HealthComponent.gd - Can be used by player, enemies, destructible objects
extends Node
class_name HealthComponent

@export var max_health: int = 100
var current_health: int

func take_damage(amount: int):
    current_health -= amount
    EventBus.emit_signal("health_changed", current_health, max_health)
    
    if current_health <= 0:
        EventBus.emit_signal("entity_died", get_parent())
```

### 4. Resource Management

**Organize your assets**:
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Group related assets in folders
- Preload frequently used resources
- Use Godot's resource system for game data

```gdscript
# Good resource organization
const PLAYER_TEXTURE = preload("res://assets/textures/player.png")
const JUMP_SOUND = preload("res://assets/audio/sfx/jump.ogg")
```

### 5. Error Handling

Always check for potential errors:

```gdscript
# Check if resources exist
if not audio_library.has(sound_name):
    print("Warning: Sound '", sound_name, "' not found")
    return

# Validate scene changes
if not scene_paths.has(scene_name):
    print("Error: Scene '", scene_name, "' not found")
    return
```

### 6. Performance Considerations

**Object Pooling**: Reuse objects instead of creating/destroying them
```gdscript
# Instead of instantiating bullets constantly
# Use a pool of pre-created bullets
```

**Efficient Signals**: Connect signals in `_ready()`, disconnect when needed
```gdscript
func _ready():
    EventBus.connect("game_over", _on_game_over)

func _exit_tree():
    EventBus.disconnect("game_over", _on_game_over)
```

## 🔧 Adding New Features

### Adding a New Manager

1. Create script in `scripts/managers/`
2. Add to autoload in Project Settings
3. Initialize in `_ready()`
4. Connect to relevant EventBus signals

### Adding a New Game Entity

1. Create scene in appropriate folder (`scenes/Game/` or `scenes/Components/`)
2. Attach script in `scripts/entities/` or `scripts/components/`
3. Use existing components when possible
4. Emit events for important state changes

### Adding UI Elements

1. Create scene in `scenes/UI/`
2. Attach script in `scripts/ui/`
3. Connect to EventBus for game state updates
4. Use tweens for animations

## 🐛 Debugging Tips

### Using the EventBus for Debugging

Add debug prints to EventBus connections:
```gdscript
func _on_player_health_changed(health: int, max_health: int):
    print("DEBUG: Player health: ", health, "/", max_health)
```

A hud for debug has been added to the boilerplate (in game). It can be displayed by the following keystore `MAJ+` 

### Manager State Inspection

Add debug methods to managers:
```gdscript
# In GameManager
func debug_print_state():
    print("Game State: ", current_state)
    print("Score: ", score)
    print("Lives: ", lives)
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Problem**: "Node not found" errors
**Solution**: Check node paths, ensure scenes are properly structured

**Problem**: Events not firing
**Solution**: Verify signal connections in `_ready()` functions

**Problem**: Audio not playing
**Solution**: Check audio library loading and file paths

## 📋 Code Style Guidelines

### Naming Conventions
- **Variables**: `snake_case` (e.g., `player_health`)
- **Functions**: `snake_case` (e.g., `take_damage()`)
- **Constants**: `UPPER_CASE` (e.g., `MAX_HEALTH`)
- **Classes**: `PascalCase` (e.g., `HealthComponent`)
- **Signals**: `snake_case` (e.g., `health_changed`)

### File Organization
- One class per file
- File name matches class name
- Group related functions together
- Use regions/comments for large files

### Comments
```gdscript
# Use comments to explain WHY, not WHAT
func calculate_damage(base_damage: int) -> int:
    # Apply critical hit multiplier based on luck stat
    if randf() < luck_percentage:
        return base_damage * 2
    return base_damage
```

## 🚀 Getting Started with Development

### Your First Feature

1. **Choose a simple feature** (e.g., collecting coins)
2. **Identify the components**:
   - Coin scene with collision detection
   - Player collision response
   - Score update
   - UI display update

3. **Implement using our architecture**:
   ```gdscript
   # In Coin.gd
   func _on_body_entered(body):
       if body.has_method("collect_coin"):
           EventBus.emit_signal("item_collected", "coin", 10)
           queue_free()
   
   # GameManager listens and updates score
   func _on_item_collected(item_type: String, value: int):
       if item_type == "coin":
           add_score(value)
   ```

4. **Test thoroughly**
5. **Document any new events or functions**

### Extending the Managers

Each manager is designed to be extended. For example, to add a new game state:

```gdscript
# In GameManager.gd, add to the enum
enum GameState {
    MENU,
    PLAYING,
    PAUSED,
    GAME_OVER,
    LOADING,
    CUTSCENE  # Your new state
}

# Add handling logic
func start_cutscene():
    current_state = GameState.CUTSCENE
    EventBus.emit_signal("cutscene_started")
```
